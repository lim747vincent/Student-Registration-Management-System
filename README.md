# Student Registration Management System âœ¨
 
## Overview

The Student Registration Management System is an object-oriented Java application developed using NetBeans, designed to streamline student enrollment, tutorial group allocation, course management, and teaching assignments. It utilizes Abstract Data Types (ADT) for Lists and Maps to efficiently manage data structures and implements Merge Sort within the List ADT for optimized sorting operations.


## Features
### Student Registration Management Subsystem
- Add, remove, and update student records.
- Search students based on registered courses.
- Assign students to main, elective, resit, and repeat courses.
- Remove students from course registrations.
- Calculate fees for registered courses.
- Apply filters based on criteria.
- Generate student registration summary reports.

### Tutorial Group Management Subsystem
- Manage tutorial groups within a programme.
- Assign and remove students from tutorial groups.
- Merge tutorial groups based on size or capacity.
- List and search students in tutorial groups.
- Generate enrollment and gap analysis reports.

### Course Management Subsystem
- Manage course-programme associations.
- Search courses offered in different semesters.
- Update course details and faculty allocations.
- Generate reports on course availability and multi-semester courses.

### Teaching Assignment Subsystem
- Assign tutors to courses and tutorial groups.
- Search and list tutors based on assigned courses.
- Filter tutors based on specific criteria.
- Generate teaching assignment summary reports.
  
## Technical Implementation:
### Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- Implement List ADT for managing dynamic collections of students, courses, and tutorial groups.
- Implement Map ADT for storing key-value associations (e.g., student-course relationships, tutor assignments).

### Sorting Algorithm
- Merge Sort is used within the List ADT for efficient sorting of student records, course lists, and event data

## Technologies:
- Programming Language: Java
- IDE: NetBeans
